## Workshop order

- The program starts with the main function of the Tester class.
- It will create 2 new Guitar objects, the first one with no attributes whatsoever, while the second one has all the attributes.
- It will then print out the attributes of both objects.
- It will then change the value price of the first Guitar object to 3000.
- It will then print out the price attribute of the first Guitar object.


## Workshop questions
`What is stored in the static heap, stack, dynamic heap?`
- Static heap: store static variables, constants, and class definitions.
- Stack: stores local variables, function parameters, and function return addresses.
- Dynamic heap: stores objects and arrays.

`What are objects in the program?`
- Objects are instances of classes. They are created in the dynamic heap.

`What is the state of obj1, obj2?`
- obj1: doesn't have any value for all attributes. 3000 for the price after changing.
- obj2: serialNumber = G123, price = 2000, builder = Sony, model = Model123, backWood = hardWood, topWood = softWood

`Do you access all fields of obj1 in the class Tester.java? Why?`
- All fields of obj1 can be accessed with the getter methods

`What is the current object when the program runs to the line “obj2.createSound();`
- It was executed in the Tester class, not an object.

`In the method main, can you use the keyword “this” to access all fields of obj2? Why?`
- No, because it is not in the scope of the object.
