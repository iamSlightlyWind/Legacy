It has come to my attention that program and code written in a linux development environment most of the time fails to compile and/or run correctly on a windows development environment, especially when using Dev C++, a mandatory program used in Software Engineering major at the FPT Education/FPT University. Therefore, any development toward the PRF192 tree will be stopped, either indefinitely or temporarily until they have changed/upgraded to a better IDE/compiler.
